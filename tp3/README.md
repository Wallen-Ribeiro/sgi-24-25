## Project information
Our 3D game revolves around a competitive hot air balloon race where players navigate a predefined track against an autonomous opponent. Players control their balloon’s altitude using simple controls—raising or lowering it to adjust to different wind layers ```WS```, each influencing the direction of movement. Staying aligned with the track is crucial, with the balloon’s shadow serving as a guide. The track includes obstacles, power-ups, and a time limit, adding complexity and urgency to the gameplay. The game penalizes track departures or collisions with timeouts.
By integrating tools like the YASF language and importing 3D models, we belive that our game allows for agile development while leaving room for creative customization.

Object picked was used for initial menu, where you can select two ballons to start the game.
Keyframe animation was used for the opponent ballon and some animation was used in the ballon movement.
There is collision detection with the power ups and out of track detection.
Spritesheets were used in the outdoors, as well shaders for the depth map (and shaders in the obstacles).
The particles were used in the Firework Box.
