## Project information
Our 3D game revolves around a competitive hot air balloon race where players navigate a predefined track against an autonomous opponent. Players control their balloon’s altitude using simple controls—raising or lowering it to adjust to different wind layers ```WS```, each influencing the direction of movement. Staying aligned with the track is crucial, with the balloon’s shadow serving as a guide. The track includes obstacles, power-ups, and a time limit, adding complexity and urgency to the gameplay. The game penalizes track departures or collisions with timeouts.
By integrating tools like the YASF language and importing 3D models, we belive that our game allows for agile development while leaving room for creative customization.
