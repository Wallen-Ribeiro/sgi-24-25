## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- Our project scene is inspired by Alfredo Linguini's room, a key character from the award-winning animated film [_Ratatouille_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/), a landmark in the world of computer graphics [Linguini's Room Fanart](https://dimasnp.artstation.com/projects/wJP549). Our scene includes our unique creative twist to meet TP1 project's requirements, while still capturing many recognizable elements from the original movie.

### [TP2 - ThreeJS Parser](tp2)


- Our project scene is inspired by the Among Us cafeteria room. Among Us is a popular multiplayer online game developed by Innersloth, first released in 2018. The game is set on a space station, where players take on one of two roles: Crewmates or Impostors. It is recognized for its simple yet engaging gameplay and became a cultural phenomenon, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our scene includes our unique creative twist to meet TP2 project's requirements, while still capturing many recognizable elements from the original video game.
