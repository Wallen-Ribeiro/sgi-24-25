## Projects

### [TP1 - ThreeJS Basics](tp1)

- Our project scene is inspired by Alfredo Linguini's room, a key character from the award-winning animated film [_Ratatouille_](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0382932/), a landmark in the world of computer graphics [Linguini's Room Fanart](https://dimasnp.artstation.com/projects/wJP549). Our scene includes our unique creative twist to meet TP1 project's requirements, while still capturing many recognizable elements from the original movie.

### [TP2 - ThreeJS Parser](tp2)


- Our project scene is inspired by the Among Us cafeteria room. Among Us is a popular multiplayer online game developed by Innersloth, first released in 2018. The game is set on a space station, where players take on one of two roles: Crewmates or Impostors. It is recognized for its simple yet engaging gameplay and became a cultural phenomenon, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic. Our scene includes our unique creative twist to meet TP2 project's requirements, while still capturing many recognizable elements from the original video game.

### [TP3 - Video Game](tp3)
## Project information


Our 3D game revolves around a competitive hot air balloon race where players navigate a predefined track against an autonomous opponent. Players control their balloon’s altitude using simple controls—raising or lowering it to adjust to different wind layers ```WS```, each influencing the direction of movement. Staying aligned with the track is crucial, with the balloon’s shadow serving as a guide. The track includes obstacles, power-ups, and a time limit, adding complexity and urgency to the gameplay. The game penalizes track departures or collisions with timeouts.
By integrating tools like the YASF language and importing 3D models, we believe that our game allows for agile development while leaving room for creative customization.
