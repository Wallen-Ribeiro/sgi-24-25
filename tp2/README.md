## Project information
Our project scene is inspired by the Among Us cafeteria room. Among Us is a popular multiplayer online game developed by Innersloth, first released in 2018. The game is set on a space station, where players take on one of two roles: Crewmates or Impostors. It is recognized for its simple yet engaging gameplay and became a cultural phenomenon, particularly during the COVID-19 pandemic.
